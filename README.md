### About Game
Guess Master is a word-guessing game developed using NextJS, Tailwind, and TypeScript. The game's rules are as follows:

At the beginning of the game, the player selects the difficulty level and category.
The player has 5 attempts to correctly guess the word.
If the player can guess the word within these 5 attempts, they win the game.

In the future, I plan to implement several enhancements to Guess Master, which I will share with you below:

- [x] To ensure the safety and security of the data, including words and categories, I will develop a backend structure for the game.
- [x] To allow users to track their progress and improve their performance, an authentication feature will be added that records past games.

These upcoming features will further enhance Guess Master's gameplay and provide users with a more personalized experience.
